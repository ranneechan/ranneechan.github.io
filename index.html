          <p>The History of Japanese Mahjong</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p><b>Mahjong</b> is a tile-based game that originated in China during the Qing dynasty. It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in South Korea and Japan). The game and its regional variants are widely played
            throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have a small following in Western countries. Similar to the Western card game rummy, Mahjong is a game of skill, strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.</p>
          <p>In 1924, a soldier named Saburo Hirayama brought the game to Japan. In Tokyo, he started a mahjong club, parlor, and school. In the years after, the game dramatically increased in popularity. In this process, the game itself was simplified from
            the Chinese version. Then later, additional rules were adopted to increase the complexity.</p>
          <p>Mahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan. As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million mahjong players and about 8,900 mahjong parlors in the country. The parlors did 300 billion yen in sales in 2008. There are several
            manga and anime devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving mahjong. Japanese video arcades have introduced mahjong arcade machines that can be connected to others over the Internet. There are also video game versions of strip mahjong.</p>

                <h2>Chī</h2>
                <p>Players can make an open sequential meld by calling out "chī" (吃 or チー) using a tile discarded by the left player, who is prior in order. Players place the meld face up on the table, usually on the right side of their hands, with the discard
                  placed sideways at the leftmost position of the meld to indicate which tile was taken from the left's discard pile.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="card__back">
                <h2>Rīchi</h2>
                <p>Declaring rīchi means declaring a ready hand, and is a kind of yaku. A player may declare ready if a player's hand needs only one tile to complete a legal hand (tenpai), and the player has not claimed another players' discards to make
                  open melds. When declaring ready, a player can win on a discard even when the hand didn't have a yaku because ready itself is a yaku. Upon declaring ready, the player must pay a deposit and may no longer change their hand except when
                  forming certain closed quads.
                  <br>As a possible rule, a player can choose to reveal their hand to win more points if successful, which is called ōpun rīchi (open rīchi). In that case, the player shows only the tiles that are related to waits, or reveals all the tiles
                  in the hand depending on the rules. The declaration increases the yaku count allowing the player to score extra points.</p>

              <div class="card__front">
                <h2>Pon</h2>
                <p>Players can make an open meld of the same three tiles by calling out "pon" (碰 or ポン) using a tile discarded by any other player. Players place the meld face up on the table with one of those tiles placed sideways to indicate from whom
                  the discard was taken.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="card__back">
                <h2>Precedence Order</h2>
                <p>The precedence order to pick up a discard when two or more players need the same discard is firstly ron (winning), secondly kan or pon, and lastly chī. Kan and pon cannot happen at the same time since there are only four of each kind of
                  tile.
                </p>
                <h2>Winning</h2>
                <p>There is a distinction between winning from the wall and winning from a discard. When going out, players call out "tsumo" (自摸 or ツモ, self-drawn) or "ron" (栄 or ロン, picking up a discard), and not "mahjong". In the case of tsumo, the other
                  three players share the responsibility of paying out points, according to the scoring table. For ron, the player who discarded the tile pays all of the points.

                <h2>Kan</h2>
                <p>There are three types of quads and players call out "kan" (槓 or カン) for all of those types. After calling a quad, the next adjacent dora indicator tile is flipped, and players need to draw a supplemental tile from the end of the dead wall.
                  Depending on the rules, the number of tiles in the dead wall is kept at 14 by reserving the last available tile from the wall, or the number decreases at that time.

                  <h3>Closed quad:</h3> Players can make a closed quad by calling out "kan" using the same four tiles in their hand. They reveal the meld on the table usually with the two inside tiles faced up and the two outside tiles faced down. A closed quad doesn't use
                  another player's discard, but a player must declare and reveal a quad if they wish to draw a supplemental tile from the dead wall. Declaring a closed quad doesn't open a hand.
                  <h3>Open quad:</h3> Players can make an open quad by calling out "kan" using another player's discard and the same three tiles in their hand. They reveal the meld on the table with all four tiles faced up, with one of those tiles placed sideways to indicate
                  from whom the discard was taken. Players cannot make this type of meld using an open meld of three tiles.
                  <h3>Added open quad:</h3> Players can make an added open quad (kakan; 加槓) by calling out "kan." They can add a self-drawn tile or a tile already in their hand to an open meld of the same three tiles. The tile is usually added sideways on top of the sideways
                  tile in the open meld.

              </div>
              <div class="card__back">
                <h2>Abortive Draws</h2>
                <p>In Japanese mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:
                  <br><b>1. </b><i>Kyūshu yaochūhai tōhai</i> (九種么九牌倒牌), or <i>Kyūshu kyūhai</i> (九種九牌): On a player's first turn when no meld has been called, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major) or honor tiles, the player may declare
                  the hand to be drawn. They could instead go for the <i>thirteen orphans</i> (<i>kokushi musō</i>) hand.
                  <br>
                  <b>2. </b><i>Sūfontsu rentā</i> (四風子連打): On the first turn without any meld calls, if all four players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.
                  <br><b>3. </b><i>Sūcha rīchi</i> (四家立直), or <i>Yonin rīchi</i> (四人立直): If all four players declare rīchi, the hand is drawn.
                  <br><b>4. </b><i>Sūkan sanra</i> (四槓算了): The hand is drawn when a fourth quad is called, unless all the four quads were called by a single player. If all four quads were called by a single player, the hand continues. In this case, depending
                  on the rules, calling a fifth quad makes the hand drawn, or calling a fifth quad is not allowed at all.
                </p>

                  <h3>Added open quad:</h3> Players can make an added open quad (kakan; 加槓) by calling out "kan." They can add a self-drawn tile or a tile already in their hand to an open meld of the same three tiles. The tile is usually added sideways on top of the sideways
                  tile in the open meld.

          <p>What's Special in Japanese Mahjong?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            <h3>Yaku and yakuman</h3> <i>Yaku</i> are specific combinations of tiles or conditions that yield the value of hands. Unlike many variants, a winning hand consists of four melds requires at least one <i>yaku</i>. When scoring, each <i>yaku</i> has its own <i>han</i>            value, and the <i>han</i> works as a doubler. A winning hand needs at least one <i>yaku</i>. <i>Yakuman</i> is a value for limit hands which are hard to get, and in some variations multiple <i>yakuman</i> are applied.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Dora</h3><i>Dora</i> (ドラ) is a bonus tile that adds <i>han</i> value to a hand. Every kind of tile can become a <i>dora</i> tile. A <i>dora</i> tile adds the same number of <i>han</i> value as the number of its corresponding "<i>dora</i> indicator"
            tiles. <i>Dora</i> is not counted as <i>yaku</i>, and having it without <i>yaku</i> does not meet the one <i>yaku</i> requirement for a winning hand.
          </p>
          <p> At the start of a hand, the third tile from the back end of the dead wall on the upper stack is flipped and becomes a <i>dora</i> indicator. Then, its succeeding tile is recognized as <i>dora</i>. For example, if an indicator is a Green dragon
            (
            <img alt="MJd2.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/MJd2.png/20px-MJd2.png" width="20" height="24" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/MJd2.png/30px-MJd2.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/MJd2.png/40px-MJd2.png 2x"
            data-file-width="44" data-file-height="53">), Red dragons (<img alt="MJd1.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MJd1.png/20px-MJd1.png" width="20" height="24" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MJd1.png/30px-MJd1.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1b/MJd1.png/40px-MJd1.png 2x"
            data-file-width="44" data-file-height="53">) are counted as <i>dora</i> by the sequence shown below, in which the Red dragon wraps around to the White dragon (<img alt="MJd3.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/MJd3.png/20px-MJd3.png"
            width="20" height="24" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/MJd3.png/30px-MJd3.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/MJd3.png/40px-MJd3.png 2x" data-file-width="44" data-file-height="53">).
          </p>
          <p> The number of <i>dora</i> indicators increases in the following manner: Each time a player calls a quad, the next adjacent <i>dora</i> indicator tile is flipped, starting with the fourth tile from the back end. The indicator is flipped immediately
            after the quad is called, and after that the player draws a supplemental tile for their hand from the back end of the dead wall. The number of indicators increases in that direction, which becomes five if a single player calls four quads,
            and that is the largest possible number on the upper stack (see four quads).
          </p> In addition, when a player goes out with a declaration of <i>rīchi</i> (ready hand), the tiles underneath the <i>dora</i> indicators are flipped after the win and become additional <i>dora</i> indicators, making their succeeding tiles also
          counted as <i>dora</i> which are called <i>ura-dora</i> (裏ドラ, underneath <i>dora</i>).</p>
          <p><b>Red 5 tiles: </b>A variation uses specially marked red number 5 tiles that also count as <i>dora</i> themselves, regardless of <i>dora</i> indicators. In addition, if a <i>dora</i> indicator is number 4 of the same suit as red 5 tiles, players
            acquire further <i>han</i> value. One red 5 tile for each suit is usually used, with some versions using two tiles for each suit. In some variations, tiles of other numbers such as 3 or 7 can be marked red.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Sacred discard</h3>In the sacred discard rules which are also called <i>furiten</i> (振聴 or フリテン), a winning tile can only be drawn from the wall in the following cases:

            <br>1. A player cannot win on any discard if the same tile is currently in the player's own discard pile. The rule also applies for multiple waits, that is, if any kind of tile in the discard pile can make a required combination irrespective of
            having yaku or not, a player cannot win off of any discards.
            <br>2. If another player’s discard can make a required combination irrespective of having yaku or not, a player cannot win on any discard after it until the next turn or until making an open meld.
            <br>3. After declaring ready, a player can no longer win on any discard if the player has discarded a winning tile from the wall or has passed on a winning discard.
            <br>For all of these rules, if discards are not in the discard piles because they have been called to make open melds, the rules still work for such discards.

          <p>How to Calculate Your Score in Japanese Mahjong?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
          <p>The payment to the winner of a hand is calculated as follows:
            <br> 1. Counting
            <button id="myBtn1" class="btn_black"><i>han</i> (飜)</button>
            <div id="myModal1" class="modal">
              <div class="modal-content">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <p>The total number of <i>han</i> (飜) of all the kinds of <i>yaku</i> (役; winning hand) in the hand is summed up. Each <i>dora</i> (ドラ) increases the han value of a hand. <i>Dora</i> are not regarded as <i>yaku</i>, and no hand can be won
                  without a <i>yaku</i> even if there are some
                  <i>dora</i> tiles.</p>
                <p>If there is more than one way to arrange the winning hand, the arrangement with the highest <i>han</i> is used. For example, a hand could be either <i>ryanpeikou</i> (二盃口) or <i>chītoitsu</i> (七対子), but since <i>ryanpeikou</i> is three
                  <i>han</i> where <i>chītoitsu</i> is two
                  <i>han</i>, <i>ryanpeikou</i> should prevail. Some yaku have their <i>han</i> value reduced by one if the hand is not closed.
                </p>
                <p> If a hand has five <i>han</i> or more, it is always counted by <i>mangan</i> (満貫) as a unit and it is not necessary to calculate <i>fu</i> (符) or basic points.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <br> 2. If it is five <i>han</i> or more, it is
            <button id="myBtn2" class="btn_black"><i>mangan</i> (満貫)</button> or more and the calculation of basic points is omitted
            <div id="myModal2" class="modal">
              <div class="modal-content">
                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <p>When it is clear that a hand reaches basic points of more than 2,000, it is limited to full basic points of 2,000 and called <i>mangan</i> (満貫). A hand of five <i>han</i> or more is always counted as a multiple of <i>mangan</i>. In those
                  cases there is no need to calculate basic points.
                  <br> One <i>han</i> cannot reach <i>mangan</i> because 110 fu × 2<sup>(2+1)</sup> = 880
                  < 2,000. (With one han, 110 fu is the maximum.)<br>
                    Two <i>han</i> cannot reach <i>mangan</i> because 110 fu × 2<sup>(2+2)</sup> = 1,760
                    < 2,000. (With two han, 110 fu is also the maximum.)<br>When a hand has 120 <i>fu</i> or more, it always has some <i>yaku</i> of three <i>han</i> or more.</p>
                <p>
                  <h3>Mangan</h3>3 <i>han</i>, 70 <i>fu</i> or more; 4 <i>han</i>, 40 <i>fu</i> or more; 5 <i>han</i>
                  <br>1 × <i>mangan</i>
                  <br>12,000 (dealer) 8,000 (non-dealer)</p>
                <p>

            <br> 3. Counting
            <button id="myBtn3" class="btn_black"><i>fu</i> (符)</button>

                <span class="close">&times;</span>
                <p><i>Fu</i> (符) is counted in the order below and then rounded up to the tens. There may be variations of rules for counting it.
                  <br>[Three <i>han</i> with 70 <i>fu</i> or more] and [four <i>han</i> with 40 <i>fu</i> or more] yield more than mangan and there is no need to calculate basic points.
                  <br>1. A winning hand is automatically awarded 20 <i>fu</i>. This is called <i>fūtei</i> (副底).
                  <br>2. Ten <i>fu</i> are added if one wins by claiming a discarded tile with a closed hand. This is called <i>menzen-kafu</i> (門前加符).
                  <br>3. Add <i>fu</i> of the melds and the pair. (See the list below.)
                  <br>4. Add <i>fu</i> according to how the waiting was. (See the list below.)
                  <br>5. Add two <i>fu</i> if one wins by self-draw. This way of winning is called <i>tsumo</i> (自摸, or ツモ). However, if the winning hand includes a <i>yaku</i> of no-points hand (<i>pinfu</i>, 平和), in most rules the two <i>fu</i> are not
                  awarded and the hand is counted as a total of 20 <i>fu</i>.
                  <br>6. Winning with <i>yaku</i> which include seven pairs (<i>chītoitsu</i>, 七対子) is counted as 25 <i>fu</i> altogether. The value is not rounded up to the tens. Some rules say seven pairs has 50 <i>fu</i> and one <i>han</i>, especially
                  in the Kansai region.
                  <br>7. As an exception, if one wins by claiming a discard with an open hand with melds and waits to which no <i>fu</i> is awarded, the hand is not 20 <i>fu</i> but counted as a total of 30 <i>fu</i>. This is the <i>fu</i> for an open <i>pinfu.</i></p>
                <p>
                  <h3>Fu of melds</h3><i>minkō</i> (明刻), or <i>min-kōtsu</i> (明刻子) (open same three tiles meld, an open triplet): 2 <i>fu</i> (non-terminal tiles), 4 <i>fu</i> (terminal or honor tiles)
                  <br><i>ankō</i> (暗刻), or <i>an-kōtsu</i> (暗刻子) (closed same three tiles meld, a closed triplet): 4 <i>fu</i> (non-terminal tiles), 8 <i>fu</i> (terminal or honor tiles)
                  <br><i>minkan</i> (明槓), or <i>min-kantsu</i> (明槓子) (open same four tiles meld, an open kan): 8 <i>fu</i> (non-terminal tiles), 16 <i>fu</i> (terminal or honor tiles)
                  <br><i>ankan</i> (暗槓), or <i>an-kantsu</i> (暗槓子) (closed same four tiles meld, a closed kan): 16 <i>fu</i> (non-terminal tiles), 32 <i>fu</i> (terminal or honor tiles)
                  <br><i>shuntsu</i> (順子) (sequential meld, a run): 0 <i>fu</i>
                  <br><i>toitsu</i> (対子) (two tiles group, the pair): 2 <i>fu</i> for seat wind tiles, prevailing wind tiles or dragon tiles. 4 <i>fu</i> (or 2 <i>fu</i> in some rules) when the seat wind and prevailing wind match. 0 <i>fu</i> for other tiles
                  <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <h3>Fu of waits</h3><i>ryanmen-machi</i> (両門待ち) (sequential tile waits for both sides): 0 <i>fu</i>
                  <br><i>kanchan-machi</i> (嵌張待ち) (sequential single tile waits for a middle tile): 2 <i>fu</i> (waiting for one kind of tile)
                  <br><i>penchan-machi</i> (辺張待ち) (sequential single tile waits for a right or left side (number 3 or 7)): 2 <i>fu</i> (waiting for one kind of tile)
                  <br><i>tanki-machi</i> (単騎待ち) (single tile waits for two pieces meld): 2 <i>fu</i> (waiting for one kind of tile)
                  <br><i>shanpon-machi</i> (双碰待ち) (waits for either of melds of same three tiles): 0 <i>fu</i>; However, a triplet is made, so 2, 4, or 8 <i>fu</i> of melds is added</p>

            <br> 4. If it is clear that the <i>han</i> and <i>fu</i> yield more than <i>mangan</i>, the calculation of basic points is omitted
            <br> 5. Calculating the basic points based on the <i>fu</i> and <i>han</i>
            <br> 6. Multiplying the basic points depending on whether the winner is the dealer or non-dealer, and whether the hand is won by <i>tsumo</i> or <i>ron</i>
            <br> 7. Adding bonuses based on the number of counters
            <br> (8. Adjusting the payment by the <i>wareme</i> rule)
            <br> In the case of a draw, points are transferred according to the <i>nō-ten bappu</i> rule. In the event of a penalty, such as claiming a win with an illegal hand, then points are transferred via the <i>chombo</i> rule.</p>

          <p>A game ends after the last hand of the last round, which is usually the South (prevailing wind) round.</p>
          <p>
            <h3>Running out</h3> A game ends when a player's score becomes zero or less, or when it falls below zero depending on the rules. Some rules may allow continued gameplay with a player having a negative point value.</p>
          <p>
            <h3>Win and finish</h3> In the rule of <i>win and finish</i> (<i>agari-yame</i>, あがりやめ), if the dealer in the last hand of the last round wins, they can select to end the game immediately or to play an additional hand, for instance when they are the top player at
            the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>Continuing into West</h3> If the points of the top player are below 30,000 after the last hand of the last round, the game continues into the West round (西場) in some rules. This situation is called <i>shānyū</i> (西入; entering West). The prevailing wind becomes west.
            A North round (北場) may come next in the same way. Depending on the rules, it can be followed by an East round again or instead White dragon, Green dragon, Red dragon and East rounds. Any extra round ends as soon as one player has 30,000 points
            or more.
